# Snake Game & Deep Learning Player

## **Done in 2021.2**

### this simple project is based in Reinforcement and Deep Q Learnings, and a simple game made in pygame : ).
* there a version of the same project made for flappy bird [**! discontinued !**]
---

### Stack:
 - Pytorch - for training and prediction alghoritms
 - Pygame - for the game base and testing
---

### Tecniques of M.L used:

_**Reinforcement**_ - Basicaly is a tecnique to teach a software to behave in an enviroment by telling it how good it's doing.

_**Deep Q**_ - Extension of Reinforcement tecnique that uses neural network to predictions, where Q = Quality of an action.
